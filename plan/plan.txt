Most relevant:
Eilers+2017: good to start with, it's a mostly observational paper that inspired many work on proximity zones. One particular interesting things they found is the population of very small proximity zones.
Davies+2020: explains a lot of physics of the proximity zones, especially the time-dependency
Chen+2021: explains our simulation and code
Suggested:
Bolton+2007: one of the earliest proximity zone modeling paper, which Davies+2020 and Chen+2021' codes are mostly based on.
Satyavolu+2023: analyzes the proximity zone size distribution with certain duty cycle using sightlines from cosmological sims.



Goal:

1.Understand how the proximity zone features fluctuate with quasar light curve at different timescales

2.For pre-Lyman limit systems (LLSs), what kind of light curve will truncate PZ?
    2.1 Go to box F to find sightlines with pre-LLSs
    2.2 Characterize the pre-LLSs (NHI, transmitted flux)


Technical tasks:
1. Set up an account on CITA machine
2. Read one uniform-grid snapshot of CROC simulation, locate the halos in the box:
    2.1 The file is at /fs/lustre/cita/hqchen/data/z-ifrit-a=0.1401.bin It's a cube with gas neutral fraction, density contrast, temperature. To read (and plot) it, use the scripts in codes/ (read_cube.py or read_and_plot_datacube.ipynb)
    2.2 The halo catalog is at /fs/lustre/cita/hqchen/data/hlist_0.14005.list
